# ProDash Tools (Factory Factory)

## Overview
ProDash Tools is a meta-platform designed to accelerate and standardize the development of business applications. It serves as a "Factory Factory" - a platform that not only helps build applications but also continuously improves the development process itself. The primary goal is to never solve the same problem twice, ensuring maximum efficiency and consistency across all projects.

## Key Features
1. **Force Multiplier** - One developer can now accomplish what would normally require a team
2. **Institutional Knowledge Preservation** - Your lessons learned are baked into the system
3. **Accelerating Returns** - Each project makes the platform better for all future projects
4. **Difficult to Replicate** - Competitors would need years to build this infrastructure

## Getting Started
1. Follow the New Project Guide in `src/docs/guides/NewProjectGuide.html`
2. Use the Builder Guide in `src/docs/guides/BuilderGuide.html` for project creation
3. Consult the Factory Guide in `src/docs/guides/FactoryGuide.html` for platform maintenance

## Core Principles
- Every solution should be captured for reuse
- Maintain clean, well-documented templates
- Regular updates to guides and documentation
- Continuous improvement of the factory itself
- Never solve the same problem twice
- Build for maintainability and scalability

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies. Additional requirements:
- Docker Desktop
- GitHub Desktop
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Cloud Platform account

## Contributing
When working on new projects:
1. Identify reusable components
2. Document new solutions
3. Update templates and guides
4. Enhance automation scripts

## Best Practices
- Use conventional commits for version control
- Follow coding standards in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Run tests before submitting changes
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Document lessons learned and solutions
- Share knowledge through templates and guides

Remember: This is a living system that grows stronger with each project!
