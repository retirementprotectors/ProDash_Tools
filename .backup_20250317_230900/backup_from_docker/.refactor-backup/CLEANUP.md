# ProDash Tools Cleanup Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the major cleanup and refactoring performed on the ProDash Tools codebase.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
The project has been refactored from a chaotic structure with overlapping functionality into a clean, organized structure:

```
/prodash-tools/
├── api/               # API routes and server
├── core/              # Core utilities and services
│   ├── context-keeper # Context management services 
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions
├── dashboard/         # Frontend dashboard
├── cli/               # Command-line utilities
├── templates/         # Project templates
├── docs/              # Documentation
└── tests/             # Test files
```

### 2. Removed Monitoring and Alerts
The problematic Monitoring and Alerts functionality was removed from both frontend and backend to improve stability and reduce complexity.

### 3. Scripts Created

Three scripts were created to perform the refactoring:

1. **cleanup-refactor.sh**: Initial migration of files to new structure
2. **setup.sh**: Configuration of shell integration and dependencies
3. **proper-cleanup.sh**: Aggressive removal of redundant files

### 4. Improved Port Management
We simplified the port handling for the frontend components by hardcoding them to connect to the correct backend port.

### 5. Backup and Safety Measures
Multiple backups were created during the refactoring process and stored in `.refactor-backup/`.

## Running the System

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Start the dashboard (in a separate terminal)
npm run dev:dashboard

# Set up shell integration
source ./prodash-tools/cli/command_wrapper.sh
```

## Creating New Projects

```bash
# Create a new project
prodash-create my-new-project
```

## Current Status
The codebase is now clean, well-organized, and follows modern best practices. Redundant files have been removed, and the system is working efficiently.
